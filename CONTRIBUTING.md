- Ensure your feature or fix passes all tests.
- Make sure your commit messages are clear and appropriate.

#### Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Fork the repository.**
2. **Create a new branch** from the `main` branch.
3. **Commit your changes** to your branch.
4. **Push your changes** to your fork.
5. **Submit a pull request** from your fork to the `main` branch of the original repository.

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Follow [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) best practices:
  - Use `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/`, `release/`, `hotfix/`, and `support/` prefixes for branch names.
  - Regularly rebase your feature branch with the `main` branch to keep up to date.
  - Merge your feature branch into `main` once it is complete.
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
- Optionally consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - :bug: `:bug:` for a bug fix.
  - :sparkles: `:sparkles:` for a new feature.
  - :memo: `:memo:` for documentation.
  - :rocket: `:rocket:` for performance improvements.
  - :lipstick: `:lipstick:` for UI improvements.

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
- Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting.
- Write [docstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).
- Use type hints where possible.
- Follow [Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) rules for linting:
  - Install Ruff with `pip install ruff` in your development environment or with `rye` as [documented](README.md#development-setup).
  - Run Ruff with `ruff check .` to check for linting issues.
  - Use `ruff --fix` to automatically fix issues where possible.
